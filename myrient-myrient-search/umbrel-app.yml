description: >-
  A self-hosted search engine that crawls and indexes the entire Myrient game archive
  (myrient.erista.me), providing instant full-text search across 2.8 million+ files.


  Features include FTS5-powered search with BM25 ranking, smart incremental sync
  with content-hash change detection, multi-select filters for collection, platform,
  manufacturer, and region, sort by relevance, name, size, type, platform, region,
  or date, a "Recently Added" indicator for new entries, and a dark theme UI
  inspired by the Myrient aesthetic.


  Built with FastAPI, SQLite FTS5, and vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. The database is fully
  self-contained — no external dependencies required. First sync takes about 30 minutes
  to index all files, then incremental syncs are fast thanks to content-hash
  change detection that skips unchanged directories.
